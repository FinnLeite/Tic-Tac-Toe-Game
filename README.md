# Tic Tac Toe Game
Because this is my first project in C#, I ran into many problems while I was coding. One of the first problems I encountered was the fact I was able to make multiple moves before the CPU's move. I was able to fix this by disabling the entire board for 1000ms. The second problem I ran into was being able to overwrite the CPU's move. It took me a while to fix this, but I was able to disable the CPU's button by creating an if statement which disables the button when the text is "O". This also made me realize I could click on the square I already clicked on, and it counted as a turn. I added a second condition to the if statement to disable the button if the text read "X". I probably couldv'e saved a lot of time by grouping all of the buttons together, but since I am very inexperienced with C# I decided to keep it the way I had it. I coded this game in Visual Studio.
